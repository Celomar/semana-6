    <h2>Day 612: Relic</h2>
      <p>It's been well over 600 days since Avin and I took up the life of bounty hunters, travelling though to the furthest reaches of the galaxy in the pursuit of loot, fame, and -more importantly- Adventure.</p>
      <p> This life got pretty boring past the 300th day and we've just been doing the rounds ever since. It's become a job now, not a hobby. It's no longer fun. But now, 612th day we've come across something worth our time:</p>

      <p>This is called a "video-game" it is from Earthling origin. These are some of the most <i>fun</i> artifacts we've come across, so much so I don't think I'll be collecting the bounty for it. We'll keep it. This one in particular goes by the name <strong>"MEGAMAN X"</strong> and it's about a fighting robot that needs to defeat some...other...robots? It's really fun, it is not about the story with these, I wish we could explain.</p>

    <h2>Day 615: Hunting something else now</h2>
    <p>Forget bounty hunting, we're collecting these now. This one is called <strong>"Earthbound"</strong> and it plays <i>very</i> differently, a "turn-based" game if you will. It also very well emulates life on earth which I find particularly endearing.</p>

<p>If we're putting all of our focus into hunting these down for our own pleasure...There must be a way to monetize this. Maybe if we were to broadcast these, as if it was a show in which we get to play for a watchful audience..That would be interesting. But would we even get an audience? Would anyone watch a couple of guys playing videogames online?
  We'll never now unless we try.
